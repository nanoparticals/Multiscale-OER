MF-MKM is a basic average field microscopic dynamic representation, without considering the quality, quantity, and distribution. 

The Multiscale-OER model is a multi-scale model that we have constructed. This model can be used to simulate the electrocatalytic performance of the OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction). The file can be directly run for calculations after installing COMSOL version 6.2. We hope that by developing multi-scale models, we can bridge the gap between theoretical calculations and experimental results. We welcome any additions or improvements to the model.

1. Parameters Section
  Parameter 1: A variable required for the multi-scale model. Users can modify or add parameters to align simulations with experimental conditions. To check parameter usage in COMSOL, use Ctrl+F 
  to search for variables.

  free_energy: Section for calculating free energy changes.

  Cdl: Double-layer capacitance estimated using Gouy-Chapman theory.

  Expressions:
  x2c: Converts mole fraction to molar concentration.

  c2x: Converts molar concentration to mole fraction.

  Activation energy calculation: Implemented in annotation an4 using CatMap.

  Equilibrium constants: Defined in annotation an5.

2. Variables Section
  Proton Group:
  Variable 1: Unifies variable names for the cathode region, aligning right boundary variables with electrolyte solution variables.

  Variable 2: Unifies variable names for the anode region, aligning left boundary variables with electrolyte solution variables.

  Variable 3: Unifies variables in the ion-exchange membrane with electrolyte variables.

  Anode/Cathode Reaction Rates: Includes detailed microkinetic equations, interface current density, and turnover frequency (TOF) calculations.

3. Boundary ODEs
  Boundary ODE/DAE 1: Solves coverage of adsorbed intermediates for the anode OER (oxygen evolution reaction) using boundary ordinary differential equations.

  Boundary ODE/DAE 2: Solves coverage of adsorbed intermediates for the cathode HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) using boundary ordinary differential equations.

4. Secondary Current Distribution
  Uses the Poisson equation to calculate ion concentration distributions in realistic electrolysis environments. Integrates microkinetically computed current densities into the total interfacial 
  current density.

5. Rare Material Transfer (Anode)
  Applies the Nernst-Planck equation (coupled with the Poisson equation in multiphysics) to compute reaction rates of interfacial ion concentrations and ion distribution in the electrolyte.

6. Mesh Settings
  Grid Type: "Extremely fine" mesh to resolve ion diffusion dynamics.

7. Study Configuration
  Current Distribution Initialization: Reduces computation time and improves convergence.

  Solver Setup:
  Initialization: Fully coupled method with the PARDISO solver.

  Transient Multiphysics Model: Solved using the MUMPS solver.

In the fcp folder, you can view all the initial structures from our DFT calculations that have not undergone structural optimization. In the fcp_calculate folder, you can find the fcp.py script and the submission script vasp-mu01.sh, which is tailored for the computing cluster I use. For the calculations, you only need to include fcp.py and POSCAR, along with preparing the submission script, to perform FCP calculations.

The principles and usage instructions for FCP can be found at: https://github.com/hellozhaoming/FCP-vasp-ase.
